What __v Means ??? 

 __v is the version key:
By default, Mongoose adds this field to every document.
It is used internally to keep track of how many times a document has been modified.
============================================================================================

==>> Initial value ??

When a document is first created, __v is set to 0.
Increment behavior:
Each time you update the document, Mongoose may increment __v to reflect the new version.

==================================================================================================

==>> Why It Exists ??

Mongoose uses __v to prevent conflicting updates.
Example: If two processes try to update the same document at the same time, Mongoose checks the __v value. If the version has changed since the process last read it, the update can be rejected to avoid overwriting someone else’s changes.
